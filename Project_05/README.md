# Public perceptions of AI in education

## Description
This project aims to analyze public perceptions of artificial intelligence in education over a one-month period. By studying opinions, concerns, and expectations regarding AI's role in teaching, learning, and educational management, the project will provide insights into public sentiment, key issues, and potential policy recommendations.

## Objective
- Understand the general sentiment about AI in education.
- Identify key themes (e.g., ethical concerns, effectiveness, access, and equity).
- Explore demographic and geographical differences in perceptions.
- Provide actionable recommendations for stakeholders in education.

### Data Points
Collected through surveys or interviews:
- **Demographics**: Age, gender, educational background, profession, location.
- **Sentiment Scores**: Opinions on the positive, neutral, or negative impact of AI in education.
- **Specific Concern**s: Ethical issues, data privacy, job displacement.
- **Applications of AI**: Perceptions on AI tools like adaptive learning platforms, automated grading, and administrative tools.
- **AI Readiness**: Self-reported familiarity with AI technologies in education.

### Methodology
- **Survey**: Design and distribute surveys targeting diverse demographic groups. Use platforms like Google Forms.
- **Social Media Scraping (if possible)**: Use APIs (e.g., Twitter API) to collect posts related to AI in education.
- **Descriptive Analysis**: Analyze collected data using charts and graphs to identify trends and disparities.

### Expected Outcomes
- Insights into Sentiment: A clear breakdown of positive, negative, and neutral perceptions of AI in education.
- Insights into how different demographic groups vary in their perception to and engagement with the AI tools in education.
- Identify public concerns, such as ethical challenges, accessibility issues, or the impact on educators.
- Data-driven suggestions for **policymakers**, **educational institutions**, and **AI developers**.

### Remark
Although this project will be completed within a month, its findings could lead to further research or a publication in the future.
